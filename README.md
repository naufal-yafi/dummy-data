<h5>Why I Made this?</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am still in the second semester and I have a <b>statistical assignment</b> with <i>multiple regression</i> material, this assignment is intended as a final project to pay off this semester. And I was told to make <b>90 fake data</b> which will later be tested by calculations and research. So the data must be mutually sustainable and logical. And that's the reason I made this program. And the object of my research is <b>student achievement</b>.

<p>
<h5>Description:</h5>
X1 : Perseverance <br>
X2 : Parental Guidance <br>
Y  : Student Achievement
<br>
<i>X1 and X2 are influencing factors on the variable Y</i>
</p>

<p>
<h5>Terms:</h5>
If, X2 has high points, then X1 also has high points. <br>
    And X1 will later affect the value of the Y variable.
